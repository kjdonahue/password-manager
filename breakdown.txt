Added for posterity.  The initial discussion of how to structure our password
manager.

Possible breakdown of modules

- GUI
- Logging module(s) (Server side)
- Password hashing/cryptography module (Server-side ?)
- Account management module (Client side & server side) - this probably includes the client view
    of their stored passwords log
- Networking module
- Administrative functions module (Client side?)
- Authentication module (Server side)
